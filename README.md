# CSS-Course-Notes

Hello Forks!
this is Suraj, how's it going guys 

So basically in this Repository, I shared what I learned about the basics of CSS,
and in this, I also shared some resources like notes...

I hope that this repository will help you as an absolute beginner 

And if you want a complete Roadmap for Frontend Development or for any other tech field then 
you can go to "roadmap.sh" this is the website name where you can find lots of roadmaps for completely free...
